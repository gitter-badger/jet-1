M and N -> holds when (in addition to M and N holding)

x < a and x < b -> -
x <= a and x < b -> -

x = a and x < b -> b == a
x = a and x > b -> b == a

x < a and x > b (b < x < a) -> a > b
x <= a and x > b (b < x <= a) -> a > b
x <= a and x >= b (b <= x <= a) -> a >= b

x=[3 5 9 12]

if x^2 - 3x > x^3 - 2x^2 + x
    x = 1 / x
